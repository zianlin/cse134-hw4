Changelog

Biggest change is the introduction of hamburger menu functionality: now the icon will open up a menu that lists all the sections of the page. Clicking on any of these listed sections will jump the user to that section. As it should, this hamburger menu only shows up on tablet/phone-sized screens.

I also added rounded corners to the images to make them look a little more appealing. In addition, I also fixed a margin error that was present on desktop where the project images would be directly next to their text descriptions: this has been remedied now.

Finally, I removed the last remnants of HW1 where I introduced trivial styling elements in order to use all the elements, e.g. using span styling on the word 'Muir' in the Awards section has now been removed.
